Memory and History explores the different aspects of the study of this field. Taking examples from Europe, Australia, the USA and Japan and treating periods beyond living memory as well as the recent past, the volume highlights the contours of the current vogue for memory among historians while demonstrating the diversity and imagination of the field. Each chapter looks at a set of key historical and historiographical questions through research-based case studies: How does engaging with memory as either source or subject help to illuminate the past? What are the theoretical, ethical and/or methodological challenges that are encountered by historians engaging with memory in this way, and how might they be managed? How can the reading of a particular set of sources illuminate both of these questions? The chapters cover a diverse range of approaches and subjects including oral history, memorialization and commemoration, visual cultures and photography, autobiographical fiction, material culture, ethnic relations, the individual and collective memories of war veterans.

Analysis and logic exercises enable the translation and parsing of genuine ancient Greek sentences, with compelling reading selections in English and in Greek offering starting points for contemplation, debate, and reflection. A series of embedded Learning Tips help teachers and students to think in practical and imaginative ways about how they learn. This combination of memory-based learning and concept- and skill-based learning gradually builds the confidence of the reader, teaching them how to learn by guiding them from a familiarity with the basics to proficiency in reading this beautiful language.

Turner similarly emerges as a conflicted subject, one whose artistic modernism emerged out of a desire to both continue and exceed his eighteenth-century aesthetic background by responding to the altered political and historical circumstances of the nineteenth century.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781351561846"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1351561847"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 369, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Art"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DicxDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DicxDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=DicxDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=history%2Bsubject&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=9&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=DicxDwAAQBAJ&dq=history%2Bsubject&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/J_M_W_Turner_and_the_Subject_of_History.html?hl=&id=DicxDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.com/books/download/J_M_W_Turner_and_the_Subject_of_History-sample-epub.acsm?id=DicxDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.com/books/download/J_M_W_Turner_and_the_Subject_of_History-sample-pdf.acsm?id=DicxDwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=DicxDwAAQBAJ&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Structured around the linked themes of making and unmaking, of creation and destruction, this book examines how Turner&#39;s history paintings reveal changing notions of individual and collective identity at a time when the British Empire was ..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "2py3swEACAAJ", "etag": "bgGW1ggdh88", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/2py3swEACAAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "U.S. History", "authors": ["P.

Learn the Secret to Success! After nearly 20 years of teaching Lewis Morris discovered a startling fact: Most students didn\u2019t struggle with the subject, they struggled with the language. It was never about brains or ability. His students simply didn\u2019t have the knowledge of the specific language needed to succeed. Through experimentation and research, he discovered that for any subject there was a list of essential words, that, when mastered, unlocked a student\u2019s ability to progress in the subject. Lewis called this set of vocabulary the \u201cInsider\u2019s Words\u201d. When he applied these \u201cInsider\u2019s Words\u201d the results were incredible. His students began to learn with ease. He was on his way to developing the landmark series of workbooks and applications to teach this \u201cInsider\u2019s Language\u201d to students around the world.", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Study Aids"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SHi1DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SHi1DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=SHi1DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA307&dq=history%2Bsubject&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=17&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SHi1DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SHi1DwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 3.99, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 3.99, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SHi1DwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-SHi1DwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 3990000, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 3990000, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "giftable": true}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.com/books/download/SAT_U_S_History_Subject_Test_Vocabulary-sample-pdf.acsm?id=SHi1DwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=SHi1DwAAQBAJ&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Learn the key words of the SAT United States <b>History Subject</b> Test Lewis Morris.

"authors": ["Richard Eldridge"], "publisher": "Oxford University Press", "publishedDate": "2017-12", "description": "Developing work in the theories of action and explanation, Eldridge argues that moral and political philosophers require accounts of what is historically possible, while historians require rough philosophical understandings of ideals that merit reasonable endorsement. Both Immanuel Kant and Walter Benjamin recognize this fact. Each sees a special place for religious consciousness and critical practice in the articulation and revision of ideals that are to have cultural effect, but they differ sharply in the forms of religious-philosophical understanding, cultural criticism, and political practice that they favor. Kant defends a liberal, reformist, Protestant stance, emphasizing the importance of liberty, individual rights, and democratic institutions. His fullest picture of movement toward a moral culture appears in Religion within the Bounds of Mere Reason, where he describes conjecturally the emergence of an ethical commonwealth. Benjamin defends a politics of improvisatory alertness and consciousness-raising that is suspicious of progress and liberal reform. He practices a form of modernist, materialist criticism that is strongly rooted in his encounters with Kant, H\u00f6lderlin, and Goethe. His fullest, finished picture of this critical practice appears in One-Way Street, where he traces the continuing force of unsatisfied desires. By drawing on both Kant and Benjamin, Eldridge hopes to avoid both moralism (standing on sharply specified normative commitments at all costs) and waywardness (rejecting all settled commitments). And in doing so, he seeks to make better sense of the commitment-forming, commitment-revising, anxious, reflective and sometimes grownup acculturated human subjects we are.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780190847364"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0190847360"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 257, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Literary Criticism"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4l0vDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4l0vDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=4l0vDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=history%2Bsubject&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=35&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=4l0vDwAAQBAJ&dq=history%2Bsubject&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Images_of_History.html?hl=&id=4l0vDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.com/books/download/Images_of_History-sample-pdf.acsm?id=4l0vDwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=4l0vDwAAQBAJ&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Developing work in the theories of action and explanation, Eldridge argues that moral and political philosophers require accounts of what is historically possible, while historians require rough philosophical understandings of ideals that ..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "4HQjTGWNfhwC", "etag": "+OR8aicMRN4", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/4HQjTGWNfhwC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "End of History and the Last Man", "authors": ["Francis Fukuyama"], "publisher": "Simon and Schuster", "publishedDate": "2006-03-01", "description": "Ever since its first publication in 1992, The End of History and the Last Man has provoked controversy and debate.

Although Axelrod investigates some dumb decisions by stupid people and some evil decisions by evil people, the overwhelming majority of these decisions were made by good, smart people whose poor judgment produced disastrous, often irreversible results. The 35 compelling and often poignant stories, which range from ancient times to today, include: The Trojan Horse; the Children's Crusade; the sailing of the Titanic, and the false belief that it just couldn't sink; Edward Bernays's 1929 campaign to recruit women smokers; Neville Chamberlain's appeasement of the Nazis; Ken Lay's deception with Enron; and even the choice to create a \u201cNew Coke\u201d and fix what wasn't broke. As with Profiles in Audacity, the deftly drawn vignettes will pique interest, satisfy curiosity, give pleasure, and present valuable lessons. And in addition to offering the same insightful analysis of the decision-making process, Folly also includes objective post-mortems that explain what went wrong and why.
